# Web-scraping-with-selenium-and-bs4
Using bs4 and selenium for scraping nft's from raritysniper.com
1. The part1-task1 data contains list of urls of collections. 2020 were extracted at the time I was scraping.
2. In the part2-task2 data, 244000 rows of data are present. Each url requires and average of 10 mins to scrape. 
Which would mean 336 hours /14 days of continuous scraping. I tried to run it on multiple tabs but the speed remained 
same though sometimes that led to system failure.
The data is scraped from json scripts. The other apporach was hovering the page and moving the mouse pointer but 
that was taking much more time as the page loading was very slow.
